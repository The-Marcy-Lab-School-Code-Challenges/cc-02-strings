# Code Challenge: Strings

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in VScode. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Declare a function named `reverseBothStrings` that takes in two string arguments and returns the reversed version of both strings concatenated with a white space. Solve without using any `.reverse()` JavaScript methods. **Hint:** How can you use a loop iterate through a string backwards?
```
reverseString("first", "second")  //"tsrif dnoces"
reverseString("hello", "Carmen")  //"olleh nemraC"
reverseString("", "oo")       // " oo"
```

1. Declare a function named `reverseAllStrings` that takes in any number of string arguments and returns the reversed version of all the arugments concatenated with a white space. Solve without using any `.reverse()` JavaScript methods.
```
reverseString("first", "second", "third")  //"tsrif dnoces drith"
reverseString("hello")  //"olleh"
reverseString("code", "challenge", "is", "fun") // "edoc egnellahc si nuf" 
```
